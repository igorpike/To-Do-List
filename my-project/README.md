# To-Do-List

This is a minimal setup to get a React-based To-Do List application working with Vite. It includes HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some basic ESLint rules.

## Current Template
Currently, two official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Project Description
This project is a simple To-Do List application built with React and Vite. It allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, with a clean and responsive interface.
